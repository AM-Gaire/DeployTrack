# Lets GitHub Actions authenticate to AWS without any stored credentials.
#
# The alternative is creating an IAM user, generating an access key, and
# pasting it into GitHub secrets. That key is permanent, works from anywhere,
# and stays valid until someone remembers to rotate it -- which is why leaked
# AWS keys are a recurring headline. With OIDC, GitHub presents a short-lived
# signed token that AWS trusts, and the credentials it exchanges for expire in
# minutes.
